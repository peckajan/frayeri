# gluED - making patients stick to the therapy

This is a script for simplification and automatization of diabetes patient education. It is a project for [Hackhealth 2022](https://hackhealth.eu/) and [IKEM](https://ikem.cz/). The main goal is to automatically detect suitable patients for education about their treatment. Suitable patient is evalueted by data in IKEM's information system.

# What we created

We built a script that automatically detects patients suitable for education. It takes HbA1c data and based on the dynamics decides which patient is suitable for in person meeting and which can get "just" some education materials. It loads data from csv file and exports a table with who to educate and how.

# Future vision

In future we can improve our decision making process by using regression decision tree and more detailed data with use of IKEM's physical activity app. We look forward to upgrade and improve our solution.
